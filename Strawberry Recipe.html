<p>Ingredients
This simple recipe uses common ingredients and relies on either a pre-made custard powder or a scratch-made base. 
Using Custard Powder (Quick Method):<br>
2 cups whole milk<br>
2–3 tbsp strawberry or vanilla custard powder<br>
½ cup sugar (adjust to taste)<br>
1 cup fresh strawberries, finely chopped <br>
From Scratch (Richer Method):<br>
2 cups whole milk<br>
1½ cups strained strawberry puree (from about 5 cups fresh strawberries)<br>
4 egg yolks<br>
½ cup granulated sugar<br>
3 tbsp cornstarch<br>
3 tbsp cubed butter (optional, for richness)<br>
1 tsp vanilla extract (if not using vanilla bean) <br>
<h3>Instructions</h3><br>
<h4>Quick Method (Using Custard Powder)</h4><br>
<b>Prepare the Slurry:</b> In a small bowl, take a few tablespoons of cold milk and whisk in the custard powder until you have a smooth, lump-free paste.<br>
<b>Heat the Milk:</b>  In a saucepan, heat the remaining milk and the sugar over medium heat until it comes to a gentle boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.<br>
<b>Thicken the Custard:</b>  Reduce the heat to low and slowly pour the custard slurry into the boiling milk while whisking continuously to prevent lumps.<br>
<b>Cook:</b>  Continue cooking and stirring for about 2–3 minutes until the custard thickens to a creamy consistency.<br>
<b>Cool and Add Fruit</b> : Remove the pan from the heat and allow the custard to cool completely to room temperature. Stir occasionally while cooling to prevent a skin from forming. Once cooled, mix in the chopped fresh strawberries.<br>
<b>Chill: </b> Pour the mixture into serving bowls and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours (or until fully chilled) before serving. </p>
