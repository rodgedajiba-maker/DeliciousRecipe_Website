<b>Classic Chocolate Lava Cake Recipe</b><br>
<p>This recipe makes four individual cakes in 6-ounce ramekins. 
Ingredients:<br> 
½ cup unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing
6 ounces high-quality semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped
2 large eggs, room temperature
2 large egg yolks, room temperature
¼ cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder (for dusting ramekins)
Pinch of salt<br> 
<b>Optional for serving:</b> vanilla ice cream, fresh berries, or powdered sugar <br> 
<b>Instructions </b><br> 
<b>Prep Ramekins and Oven: </b>Preheat the oven to a high temperature, typically 425°F (220°C). Generously grease the inside of four 6-ounce ramekins with butter. Dust the buttered interior with cocoa powder, tapping out any excess to prevent the cake from sticking.<br> 
Melt Chocolate and Butter:</b> In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chopped chocolate and butter. Microwave in 30-second increments, stirring well after each, until the mixture is completely melted and smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.<br> 
<b>Prepare Egg Mixture:</b> In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and salt until the mixture is thick, pale, and frothy (about 2-3 minutes).
<b>Combine Ingredients:</b> On a low speed, or by gently folding with a spatula, mix the slightly cooled chocolate mixture into the egg mixture until just combined. Sift in the flour and gently fold until no streaks of flour remain, being careful not to overmix the batter.<br> 
<b>Bake: </b>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins and place them on a baking sheet. Bake for 10-14 minutes, until the sides are set but the center is still soft and slightly jiggly. Baking time is crucial and varies by oven, so watch them closely.<br> 
<b>Serve:</b> Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the ramekins for one minute. Carefully run a knife around the inner edge of each cake to loosen it, then place an inverted dessert plate over the top and flip the ramekin over. Gently lift the ramekin to unmold the cake. Serve immediately, garnished with powdered sugar or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.<br>  
Pro Tips for Success<br> 
<b>Quality Chocolate: </b>Use high-quality baking chocolate bars (like Ghirardelli or Lindt) for the best flavor and consistent melting; chocolate chips contain stabilizers and may not melt as smoothly.
<b>Don't Overbake: </b>The center should be jiggly, not firm. The high oven temperature helps the exterior bake quickly, leaving the center molten.
<b>Proper Preparation: </b>Generously buttering and dusting the ramekins with cocoa powder or flour is essential for the cakes to unmold cleanly.
<b>Make Ahead:</b> You can prepare the batter up to two days in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Let it come to room temperature before baking, or add a minute or two to the baking time if baking from cold.
