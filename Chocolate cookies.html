<center><h1>CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES RECIPE</h1></center>
<center><img src = "cookies.jpg" alt = "google"></center>
Here is a classic, easy chocolate chip cookie recipe that results in soft and chewy cookies. This recipe, adapted from popular methods like the original Toll House recipe, uses a blend of brown and white sugar for optimal flavor and texture. 
Ingredients<br>
1 cup (2 sticks/227g) unsalted butter, softened to cool room temperature<br>
¾ cup (150g) granulated white sugar<br>
¾ cup (165g) packed light or dark brown sugar<br>
1 large egg<br>
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br>
2 ¼ cups (about 280g) all-purpose flour<br>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
½ teaspoon salt (increase to 1 teaspoon if using unsalted butter)<br>
2 cups (about 340g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks<br>
Optional: 1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans) <br>
Instructions<br>
Preheat Oven<br>
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper for easy cleanup and even baking.<br>
Combine Dry Ingredients<br>
In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.<br>
Cream Butter and Sugars<br>
In a large bowl, using an electric mixer or a sturdy spoon, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and creamy (about 2-3 minutes).<br>
Add Wet Ingredients<br>
Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br>
Combine Mixtures
Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet mixture, beating on low speed or stirring with a spatula just until blended.<br>
Fold in Chocolate Chips and Nuts<br>
Stir in the chocolate chips (and nuts, if using) until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.<br>
Scoop and Bake<br>
Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.<br>
Bake<br>
Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers look soft.<br>
Cool<br>
Cool the cookies on the baking sheets for 2 minutes to let them set, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. <br>
<h3>Tips for Perfect Cookies</h3>
<b>Do Not Overbake:</b> The cookies may look slightly underdone when you remove them from the oven, but they will continue to set as they cool on the pan. This is key to a soft, chewy center.<br>
<b>Chill the Dough:</b>  For thicker, chewier cookies with a deeper, more developed flavor, cover the dough and refrigerate it for at least an hour (or up to 72 hours) before baking.<br>
<b>Use Quality Ingredients:</b>  High-quality chocolate chips or a chopped chocolate bar will give you better flavor and a nicer melt.<br>
<b>Storage: </b> Store cooled cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. Adding a slice of fresh bread to the container can help them stay soft longer. <br>
